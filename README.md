# REST API DOCUMENTATION

An API (Application Programming Interface), is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes called as RESTful APIs.

A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.

## How RESTful APIs work

REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records within a resource. For example, a REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods are used in API calls. A well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a web browser with built-in HTTP functionality.

Request headers and parameters are also important in REST API calls because they include essential identifier information such as metadata, authorizations, uniform resource identifiers (URIs), caching, and cookies. Request headers, response headers, and conventional HTTP status codes are used within well-designed REST APIs.

A request is sent from client to server in the form of web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back from server in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image or JSON.


## Common Methods of REST API

A RESTful API uses commands to obtain resources. The state of a resource at any given timestamp is called a resource representation. A RESTful API uses existing HTTP methodologies such as:

- GET - It is normally used to retrieve information from the system.
- PUT - It is used to change the state of or update a resource, which can be an object, file, or block.
- POST - It is used to create the resource.
- DELETE â€“ It is used to remove the resource.
